# self-driving-car-python
A self-driving car simulation built in Python using Pygame. The car navigates roads, handles curves, and simulates intelligent driving behavior in a virtual environment.

## 🧠 Features

- Predefined path navigation using coordinate waypoints
- Smooth car movement and turning using angle calculation
- Car image rotation based on direction
- Real-time path tracking
- Built with clean, beginner-friendly Python code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Math module
